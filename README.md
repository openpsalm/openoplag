openoplag (Open, no plagiarism!) Open source compiler for the ERPLAG language. 


ERPLAG is a strongly typed language with primitive data types as integer and floating point. It also supports two other data types: boolean and arrays.
The language supports arithmetic and boolean expressions, simple and input/output statements, declarative statements and 
conditional and iterative statements. The language supports modular implementation of the functionalities. Functions can
return multiple values. The function may or may not return a value as well. The scope of the variables is static and the variable is visible only in the block where it is declared. The language was originally designed for the Programming Languages and Compiler Construction(CS C362) course at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India.
